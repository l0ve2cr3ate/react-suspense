# 5. Suspense Image Notes

Loading images is tricky. You are handing async state over to the browser, which manages loading, error and success states for you. But what if your page doesn't look good until the image is actually loaded or if you want to render a fallback in the image's place while it's loading? The browser does not have an API for that. 

Suspense can help you in these situations. 
You can preload images into the browser's chache:

```javascript
const preloadImage = (src) => {
    return new Promise(resolve => {
        const img = document.createElement('img')
        img.src = src
        img.onload = () => resolve(src)
    })
}
```
