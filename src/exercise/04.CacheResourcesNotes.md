# 4. Cache Resources Notes

State that comes from the server is basically a cache of state. 

## Promises in Render
Creating a new promise in render method is dangerous because you cannot rely on your render method only being called once:

```javascript
const promiseCache = {}

function MySuspendingComponent({value}) {
    let resource = promiseCache[value]
    if(!resource) {
        resource = doSomethingAsync(value)
        promiseCache[value] = resource // <-- IMPORTANT!!!
    }

    return <div>{resource.read()}</div>
}
```
