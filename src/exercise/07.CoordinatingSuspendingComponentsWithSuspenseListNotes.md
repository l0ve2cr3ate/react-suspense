# 7. Coordinating Suspending Components with SuspenseList

Coordinating loading states is a hard problem, but with Suspense and `<SuspenseList />` it becomes much easier. 

The `SuspenseList` component has the following props:

- *revealOrder*: order in which suspending components are to render:
    - `undefined` = default: everything pops in when it's loaded
    - "forwards": only show component when all components before it have finished suspending
    - "backwards": only show component when all components after it have finished suspending
    - "together": don't show any of the components until they have all finished loading.
- *tail*: determines how to show fallbacks for component that should be rendered next
    - `undefined` = default: show all fallbacks
    - "collapsed": only show fallback for component that should be rendered next
    - "hidden" = opposite of default: show none of the fallbacks
- *children*: other React elements which render `<React.Suspense />` component
