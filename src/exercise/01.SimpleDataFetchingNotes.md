# 1. Simple Data Fetching Notes

Basic idea of suspense API:

```javascript
function Component() {
    if(data) {
        return <div>{data.message}</div>
    }
}

throw promise // --> React will catch this, find the closest `Suspense` component and *suspend* everything from rendering until promise resolves.
 // API is probably going to change.

 ReactDOM.createRoot(rootEl).render(
     <React.Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <Component />
    </React.Suspense>
 )
```

With help of suspense you can kick off your data request as soon as you have the info you need for the request: *Render as you fetch*

## Promises

```javascript
const handleSuccess = result => console.log(result)
const handleFailure = error => console.log(error)
const myPromise = someAsyncFunc().then(handleSuccess, handleFailure)
```
